# Machine Learning Reference List
This is a curated list of materials, books, resources, videos, blog posts, podcasts, papers, courses, and virtually any material you can use to teach yourself Machine Learning and other subdisciplines under it. You'll see annotations on each entry showing the recommended background/skill/prerequisite before checking out the resource.

We're continuosly updating this list, so be sure to recheck often!

## Mathematical Background for Machine Learning
* [(CMU 10-606) Mathematical Background for Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7y-1rk2cCsAqRtWoZ95z-GMcecVG5mzA) - Great offering from Carnegie Mellon University. Teaches the mathematical foundations needed to explore Machine Learning as a discipline of study. Highly recommended for people who want to get into ML. While previous experience on the subjects are helpful, they are not thoroughly required. ***Prerequisite: Previous Statistics/Calculus/Linear Algebra would be helpful. ST-STAT/MODESTA, CCSCAL1, CCSCAL2, and ADVDISC would be great, but not hard required.***

* [(CMU 10-705) Intermediate Statistics](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/) - Works well as a good intermediate statistics and probability course, and deals mostly with theoretical statics. Includes topics like bayesian inference, bootstrapping, nonparametric testing, etc. Roughly equal to an ADVSTAT class. ***Prerequisite: Basic Statistics and Probability. ST-STAT/MODESTA should suffice.***

* [Linear Algebra Review](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/linalg/index.html) - A refresher of the guts of Linear Algebra. Recommended to take it only if you've taken a Linear Algebra course before as it's not as in depth as other offerings. ***Prerequisite: A previous Linear Algebra course. ADVDISC would work. Do note that this is just a refresher.***

* [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) - Probably my favorite Linear Algebra short course online. 3Blue1Brown teaches super well, and does so in so many perspectives. Highly recommended! ***Prerequisite: None***
