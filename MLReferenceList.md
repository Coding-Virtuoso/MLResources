# Machine Learning Reference List
This is a curated list of materials, books, resources, videos, blog posts, podcasts, papers, courses, and virtually any material you can use to teach yourself Machine Learning and other subdisciplines under it. You'll see annotations on each entry showing the recommended background/skill/prerequisite before checking out the resource.

We're continuosly updating this list, so be sure to recheck often!

## Mathematical Background for Machine Learning
* [(CMU 10-606) Mathematical Background for Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7y-1rk2cCsAqRtWoZ95z-GMcecVG5mzA) - Great offering from Carnegie Mellon University. Teaches the mathematical foundations needed to explore Machine Learning as a discipline of study. Highly recommended for people who want to get into ML. While previous experience on the subjects are helpful, they are not thoroughly required. Coding experience is needed to implement the course materials. *\[Prerequisite: Some background on statistics and probability, linear algebra, calculus, and multivariate calculus will be helpful.\]*
