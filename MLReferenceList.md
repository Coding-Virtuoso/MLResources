# Machine Learning Reference List
This is a curated list of materials, books, resources, videos, blog posts, podcasts, papers, courses, and virtually any material you can use to teach yourself Machine Learning and other subdisciplines under it. You'll see annotations on each entry showing the recommended background/skill/prerequisite before checking out the resource.

I'm continuosly updating this list, so be sure to recheck often!

# Courses
A list of highly recommended short courses and lecture video series.

## Mathematics for Machine Learning
Machine Learning requires some mathematical prerequisites for you to understand what's going on. Generally, experience with statistics, probability, linear algebra, and multivariate calculus are hard requirements. Reading papers and books are super hard without the prerequisites, so we cannot stress how important it is to go through them first! If you're pressed with time, I recommend running through just CMU 10-606. Otherwise, the other things listed would provide really good resources. 

* [(CMU 10-606) Mathematical Background for Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7y-1rk2cCsAqRtWoZ95z-GMcecVG5mzA) - Teaches the mathematical foundations needed to explore Machine Learning as a discipline of study. Highly recommended for people who want to get into ML. While previous experience on the subjects are helpful, they are not thoroughly required. ***Prerequisite: Previous Statistics/Calculus/Linear Algebra would be helpful. ST-STAT/MODESTA, CCSCAL1, CCSCAL2, and ADVDISC would be great, but not hard required.***

* [(CMU 10-705) Intermediate Statistics](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/) - Works well as a good intermediate statistics and probability course, and deals mostly with theoretical statics. Includes topics like bayesian inference, bootstrapping, nonparametric testing, etc. Roughly equal to an ADVSTAT class. ***Prerequisite: Basic Statistics and Probability. ST-STAT/MODESTA should suffice.***

* [Linear Algebra Review](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/linalg/index.html) - A refresher of the guts of Linear Algebra. Recommended to take it only if you've taken a Linear Algebra course before as it's not as in depth as other offerings. ***Prerequisite: A previous Linear Algebra course. ADVDISC would work. Do note that this is just a refresher.***

* [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) - Probably my favorite Linear Algebra short course online. 3Blue1Brown teaches super well, and does so in so many perspectives. Highly recommended! ***Prerequisite: None***

## Introduction to Machine Learning
* [(CMU 10-701) Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10701-f16/schedule.html) - My current go-to recommendation for Introduction to Machine Learning. Solid offering from Carnegie Mellon. ***Prerequisite: Statistics, Calculus, and Linear Algebra. CMU 10-606 is recommended as a precursor. In terms of DLSU subjects, ADVDISC, ADVSTAT, and CCSCAL2 would suffice.***

* [(CS229) Intrduction to Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599) - Stanford's Introduction to Machine Learning course series. Used to be my go-to, but it's a tad bit outdated (the video quality says it all). Would rather go to CMU 10-701 unless you wanna see Andrew Ng prove theorems on six blackboards at once. ***Prerequisite: Statistics, Calculus, and Linear Algebra. CMU 10-606 is recommended as a precursor. In terms of DLSU subjects, ADVDISC, ADVSTAT, and CCSCAL2 would suffice.***
