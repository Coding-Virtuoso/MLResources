# Machine Learning Reference List
This is a curated list of materials, books, resources, videos, blog posts, podcasts, papers, courses, and virtually any material you can use to teach yourself Machine Learning and other subdisciplines under it. You'll see annotations on each entry showing the recommended background/skill/prerequisite before checking out the resource.

I'm continuosly updating this list, so be sure to recheck often!

## Mathematics for Machine Learning
Machine Learning requires some mathematical prerequisites for you to understand what's going on. Generally, experience with statistics, probability, linear algebra, and multivariate calculus are hard requirements. Reading papers and books are super hard without the prerequisites, so we cannot stress how important it is to go through them first! If you're pressed with time, I recommend running through just CMU 10-606. Otherwise, the other things listed would provide really good resources. 

* [(CMU 10-606) Mathematical Background for Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7y-1rk2cCsAqRtWoZ95z-GMcecVG5mzA) - Teaches the mathematical foundations needed to explore Machine Learning. Highly recommended for people who want to get into ML. While previous experience on the subjects are helpful, they are not thoroughly required. Recommended for beginners. Take this first if you are unsure on where to go! ***Prerequisite: Previous Statistics/Calculus/Linear Algebra would be helpful. ST-STAT/MODESTA, CCSCAL2, and ADVDISC would be great, but not hard required.***

* [Essence of Linear Algebra](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) - Probably my favorite Linear Algebra short course online. 3Blue1Brown teaches super well, and does so in so many perspectives. Recommended for beginners. ***Prerequisite: None***

* [Computational Linear Algebra](http://www.fast.ai/2017/07/17/num-lin-alg/) - Here's a more practical Linear Algebra offering from fast.ai, which does a top-down approach teaching you the essence of the subject by showing you the practical side, then going to the theoretical side. Good for people who'd want to do more coding instead of pen-and-paper gauss jordan elimination. Recommended for intermediate students. ***Prerequisite: Supposedly none. Requires you to know Numpy.***

* [Linear Algebra Review](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zkolter/course/linalg/index.html) - A refresher of the guts of Linear Algebra. Recommended to take it only if you've taken a Linear Algebra course before as it's not as in depth as other offerings. Recommended for intermediate students. ***Prerequisite: A previous Linear Algebra course. ADVDISC would work. Do note that this is just a refresher.***

* [(CMU 10-705) Intermediate Statistics](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/) - Works nicely as a theoretical take on statistical theory. Coers topics such as bayesian inference and nonparametric testing. This is not a basic statistics course, and is intended for a deep dive in intermediate statistics! Recommended for intermediate students. ***Prerequisite: Statistics and Probability. Some ADVSTAT should work.***

## Introduction to Machine Learning
Main course meal. Assumes the required mathematical background is met, ideally CMU 10-606 has been taken as a precursor. Go take CMU 10-701. 

* [(CMU 10-701) Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10701-f16/schedule.html) - My current go-to recommendation for Introduction to Machine Learning. Solid offering from Carnegie Mellon. Recommended for beginners. ***Prerequisite: Statistics, Calculus, and Linear Algebra. CMU 10-606 is recommended as a precursor. In terms of DLSU subjects, ADVDISC, ADVSTAT, and CCSCAL2 would suffice.***

* [(CS229) Intrduction to Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA89DCFA6ADACE599) - Stanford's Introduction to Machine Learning course series. Used to be my go-to, but it's a tad bit outdated (the video quality says it all). Would rather go to CMU 10-701 unless you wanna see Andrew Ng prove theorems on six blackboards at once. Recommended for beginners. ***Prerequisite: Statistics, Calculus, and Linear Algebra. CMU 10-606 is recommended as a precursor. In terms of DLSU subjects, ADVDISC, ADVSTAT, and CCSCAL2 would suffice.***

* [(CS155) Introduction to Machine Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuz4CTPOUNi644ypoxzP1frkPYVHdjDJU) - Caltech's Introduction to Machine Learning Course. Stan recommends it, Yisong Yue teaches super good daw. Recommended for beginners. ***Prerequisite: Statistics, Calculus, and Linear Algebra. CMU 10-606 is recommended as a precursor. In terms of DLSU subjects, ADVDISC, ADVSTAT, and CCSCAL2 would suffice.***

## Natural Language Processing
Course series on Natural Language Processing and computational linguistics. I learned from CS224N, and I highly recommend you take it too.

* [(CS224N) Introduction to Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqdrfNEc5QnuV9RwUAhoJcoQvu4Q46Lja) - A class from the legendary Christopher Manning of the Stanford NLP Group. My go-to recommendation for NLP-Deep Learning. Recommended for intermediate students. ***Prerequisite: An Intro to ML course, preferably CMU 10-701. A Deep Learning course is also recommened, even if Manning teaches some DL in the course itself.***
